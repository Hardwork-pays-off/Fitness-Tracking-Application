This code is for a fitness tracking application with the following constraints:

The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)=

10 * weight (kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) + 5 for (man)

10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) - 161 for ​(woman)

To determin​e your total daily calorie needs, multiply your BMR by the appropriate activity factor, as follows:

If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2

If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days​/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375

If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55

If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725

If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9

The final putput is in the file named "codeOutput".
